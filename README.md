A simple library for controlling 4-lead common-cathode and common-anode
RGB LEDs.

Note that this library is *not* for controlling digital RGB LEDs or digital
RGB LED strips (i.e., it is not intended as a replacement for libraries like
FastLED or Adafruit_NeoPixel). This library is for controlling single
4-lead RGB LEDs only.

Yes, this code is relatively simple, but I found myself rewriting it
frequently enough that I thought having a library to reuse it would make
my life a bit easier.
